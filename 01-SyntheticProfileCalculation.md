# Synthetic profile calculations


## 1. Necessary VALD lines lists

Obtained extract stellar linelists (short format) for 34 temperatures from 10500 to 31000 K, log g 3.5 or 4.0. 

Adopted 2 km/s microturbulence

These temperatures/gravities correspond to the range of observed stellar parameters. 

At this moment I canâ€™t recall where those parameters came from. (GAW: Be_2019/WORKING/VALD)

The line lists are in the FOLDER of the Shared Google Drive.
