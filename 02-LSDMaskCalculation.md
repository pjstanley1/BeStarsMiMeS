# LSD mask calculations


## 1. Necessary VALD lines lists

The generation of LSD line masks requires VALD long lists. 

We obtained long-format line list using the extract stellar form in VALD, using the following input:

* Starting wavelength: 3700
* Ending wavelength: 9000
* Detection threshold: 0.01
* Microturbulence: 2
* Line list configuration: Default. 

The line list, renamed in a longlist_TXXXXXgXX format are located in the `VALD-LongList` folder in the Shared Google drive

## 2. Converting the line lists into masks.
